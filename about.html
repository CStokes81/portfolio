          <p id="bio">
            I grew up in a small town right outside of New Orleans, Louisiana where I always had dreams and ambitions of becoming successful.  I was always taught that hardwork and education are the keys to success.  So once I graduated from high school, I immediately enrolled in college and worked at the same time.  Since then, I have received my Bachelors & Masters Degree in Business, but I've always had a passion for computers and technology.  Therefore, I started learning how to write SQL to pull simple and complex queries.  
            
            I eventually decided I wanted to learn more about development, particularly Full Stack Development, so I decided to enroll in a bootcamp at Digital Crafts.  While in this bootcamp, I not only learned how much work goes into Full Stack Development, but I also learned that development is something that I would definitely like to do on a full-time basis.  Therefore, given my 12+ years working as a Systems Analyst and effectively communicating with other developers, business subject matter experts, third-party vendors and people of all backgrounds while successfully adapting to any situation, I believe a career in Full Stack Development would be fulfilling and successful.
          </br>
        </br>
        As a Full Stack Developer, I would combine my tech skills and my passion for working with and helping people.  I look forward to joining a team that is not only committed to working as a team, but also to continuosly stay educated on the evolving world of technology through various training.

        My current stack includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, React/Redux and I also have experience working with MySQL

        When I'm not brushing up on my development skills, I enjoy reading, exercising, traveling, listening to music, and exploring cuisines and wines from various cultures.</p>
